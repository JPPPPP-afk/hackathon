# Natural Language Processing Learning Package

## Introduction

We would like to give students between 12 and 18 early exposures to Natural Language Processing - the technology behind applications that are ubiquitous in their daily lives: real-time translation and subtitling, virtual assistant, and search engines. Our Package is comprised of a HTML programme, where all the tutorial contents will be displayed. They have been written using a simplified and story-telling style of teaching, which is highly comprehensible for students with no prerequisites in the field. We also included various media of illustrations, including interactive tools (speech-to-text) for students to work with these technologies, together with self-drawn and online-sourced pictures. Our interactive tools are built upon Python and Azure cognitive services – speech. We finally provide some optional mathematical content for high school students, who might already have some idea about basic algebra.

The program demonstrates the ability of NLP transforming audio speech to text and here is the guide for installation. So far the program is only working on Win10.
